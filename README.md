#Description

This is my personal configuration of the i3-gaps window manager
together with some scripts.

##Descendence 

I started out with the great configuration provided by
the team of EndeavourOS
https://github.com/endeavouros-team
in the repo 
https://github.com/endeavouros-team/endeavouros-i3wm-setup.
Especially the scripts are theirs.

I also used the wonderful GRUVBOX colorscheme
provided by 
https://github.com/morhetz
Especially the file
https://github.com/morhetz/gruvbox-contrib/blob/master/color.table
was of great use.

##Usage

The setup uses alacritty as the terminal emulator,
thunderbird as the mail client and firefox as the browser.

It provides a scratchpad of the password manager KeePassXC
together with a scratchpad of alsamixer and python.

Strictly speaking none of those are necassary if the 
functionalities are not used.
It is also trivial to change the terminal emulator etc.
inside of the config.
